Project Title

Cancer Risk Prediction System Using Symptom Analysis

Problem Statement

Early detection of cancer significantly improves treatment success and survival rates.
However, many individuals ignore early warning symptoms due to lack of awareness, delayed medical consultation, or limited access to healthcare information.

There is a need for a simple, user-friendly system that helps individuals understand the possible risk level of cancer based on common symptoms, encouraging timely medical attention.

Proposed Solution

This project proposes a web-based Cancer Risk Prediction System that analyzes user-reported symptoms and calculates a cancer risk percentage using weighted logic.

The system does not diagnose cancer, but provides an estimated risk level (Low / Medium / High) to raise awareness and guide users toward appropriate medical consultation.

Key Features

Symptom-based input (weight loss, pain, lump, bleeding, fatigue, smoking history)

Cancer risk percentage calculation

Risk classification (Low / Medium / High)

Clean, responsive web interface

Instant results without backend dependency

Educational disclaimer to avoid medical misuse

Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Not required (client-side logic)

Deployment: Live Server / Browser-based

Workflow

User opens the web application

Selects observed symptoms using checkboxes

System assigns weights to selected symptoms

Total score is calculated

Cancer risk percentage is computed

Risk level is displayed with visual indicators

User is advised to seek medical consultation if risk is high

Innovation & Impact

Simplifies complex medical risk awareness into an accessible tool

Encourages early medical consultation

Reduces ignorance toward early cancer symptoms

Can be extended with machine learning models and clinical datasets

Limitations

Not a medical diagnostic tool

Based on general symptom patterns

Requires professional validation for real-world use

Future Enhancements

Integration of Machine Learning models

Cancer-type-specific prediction

User profile and history tracking

Doctor/hospital recommendation system

Mobile application version

Conclusion

The Cancer Risk Prediction System provides a practical, educational, and impactful solution to promote early awareness of cancer risks. With further enhancements and medical data integration, the system can evolve into a powerful preventive healthcare support tool.
