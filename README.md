🍽️ SurplusServe

Connecting Restaurants, NGOs, and Students to Fight Hunger

📌 Problem Statement

Food wastage remains a major social challenge. Large groups of restaurants frequently have surplus, edible food that goes unused, while NGOs work daily with people who cannot afford regular meals.

At the same time, many college students are searching for part-time jobs but lack technical or professional skills, limiting their employment opportunities.

Currently, there is no single platform that:

Connects restaurants donating surplus food with NGOs serving people in need

Coordinates last-mile food delivery efficiently

Provides skill-free, part-time jobs to students

Clearly manages delivery charge responsibility between restaurants and NGOs

This gap leads to food wastage, delayed distribution, and missed employment opportunities.

💡 Solution Overview

SurplusServe is a centralized food redistribution platform that enables:

Restaurants to donate surplus food

NGOs to request food for beneficiaries and share delivery locations

College students to work as delivery partners without needing skills

Admins to verify users and monitor operations

A unique feature of the platform is flexible delivery payment handling, where:

Delivery charges can be paid either by the restaurant or the NGO

Students are paid consistently regardless of who covers the delivery cost
